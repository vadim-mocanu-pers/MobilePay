1. It was requested to implement console app I disagree that it is best solution, it is difficult to configure what merchant has discount, who is fixed fee and who doesn't have privileges.
2. It was requested to get trasnaction from text file, one transaction by one, this will lead to performance issue of reading from file.
3. It doesn't specified what kind of test should be covered with, that's why because Integration test are more valuable than Unit Test I covered functionality with Integration Tests.
